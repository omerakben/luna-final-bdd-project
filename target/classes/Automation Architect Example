Create the required packages:
base
pages
stepDefinitions
Utils
Create the following classes in the respective packages:
BaseClass (base)
HomePage (pages)
RegistrationPage (pages)
SignInPage (pages)
MyAccountPage (pages)
CartPage (pages)
CheckoutPage (pages)
OrderConfirmationPage (pages)
MyOrdersPage (pages)
ViewOrderPage (pages)
PrintOrderPage (pages)
TestRunner (stepDefinitions)
UserRegistrationSteps (stepDefinitions)
UserSignInSteps (stepDefinitions)
UserSignOutSteps (stepDefinitions)
PlacingOrderSteps (stepDefinitions)
VerifyOrderSteps (stepDefinitions)
WebDriverWaitFactory (utils)
ScreenshotTaker (utils)
Constants (utils)
In the BaseClass, create a WebDriver instance and initialize it using the webdrivermanager library. Also, create methods for initializing and closing the WebDriver instance.
Create the PageObject classes for each page by implementing the PageFactory pattern. For example, in the HomePage class, create the following WebElements and methods:
@FindBy(xpath = “”)
private WebElement createAccountLink;
@FindBy(cssSelector = “”)
private WebElement signInLink;
public void clickCreateAccount() {
    createAccountLink.click();
}
public void clickSignIn() {
    signInLink.click();
}
Create Cucumber feature files in the resources/features directory for each test scenario. Write Gherkin-style scenarios for all the test cases mentioned in your question.
Implement step definitions in the respective *Steps classes for each test scenario. Use the @Given, @When, @Then, and @And annotations to map Gherkin steps to Java methods.
In the TestRunner class, create a JUnit test runner to execute Cucumber scenarios. Add the following example code:
@RunWith(Cucumber.class)
@CucumberOptions(
        features = “src/test/resources/features”,
        glue = {“stepDefinitions”},
        plugin = {
                “pretty”,
                “html:target/cucumber-reports”,
                “json:target/cucumber.json”,
                “junit:target/cucumber.xml”
        },
        monochrome = true
)
public class TestRunner {
}
In the WebDriverWaitFactory class, create methods to handle waits for element visibility, element clickability, and other wait conditions.
In the ScreenshotTaker class, create a method to capture screenshots when needed.
In the Constants class, define constants such as the BaseURL and other values that you may use throughout your test execution.
Implement the test steps in the *Steps classes using the Page Object classes created earlier. Use the methods from the WebDriverWaitFactory and ScreenshotTaker classes as needed.
Run the TestRunner class, which will execute the Cucumber scenarios and generate an HTML report under the target/cucumber-reports directory. The report will show the results of all test cases, including the positive and negative test cases for user registration, sign-in, sign-out, placing orders, and verifying orders.
